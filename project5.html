                                <p> As crossing a road might be a challenge for people who need special assistance, a signalizing button can make it easier for cars to see that a person is crossing and to drive safely. The signalizing button can assist anyone in preserving their safety, as also, crossing a road in the dark can be extremely dangerous for anyone.</p>

                                <p> The yellow sidewalk bumps can really help blind people or people with low vision to safely walk on the street, as this tactile paving signals the beginning or end of a street. I love how Brandeis has these yellow bumps around campus, as they do make the campus more accessible for people without one or more of the five senses. </p>

                               <p> I love how there are plenty of reserved parking spaces for people with disability around campus. As my grandma has mobility problems and finds it difficult to walk for a long time, my family has always loved these parking spots, which make certain places much more accessible for my grandma.</p>

                                <img src="assets/baby_station.jpg" alt="Header Image 2" />
                                <p> Before doing this group activity, I never knew that baby stations were around campus! As Heller School hosts many events with guests outside of Brandeis, I think this might be why there is a baby station in the women's bathroom there. I think this is a great design for moms with their babies and would definitely make parents' lives easier! </p>

                                <p> This accessible lift is located at the Abraham Shapiro Academic Complex. There are just two levels in this small building, but the lift has been designed specifically for staff members (as it leads to the staff offices) with ADA needs. I was so happy when I saw this lift in the building, as it showed how considerate the designers were about accommodating all people. </p>

                               <p>When we were thinking about an example of a design with an absence of help, Hannah, Zoe, and I started thinking- "What makes movement more challenging on campus?". We started thinking about the dorms, and East was the best example of a dorm that is completely inaccessible. The corridors are very narrow, and if someone uses a wheelchair, they might have difficulties moving around. I live in East, and I hate how inaccessible it can be for many people. </p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="header-image2">
                                <img src="assets/east_stairs.jpg" alt="Header Image 2" />
                                <p> The stairs in East are also a great example of a design with physical barriers. The stairs are also narrow and steep, so if someone wants to assist a person, they might now be able to do so. The conclusion that we got to is that East needs to be renovated as soon as possible.</p>

                                <p> The allergy pantry in Usdan is a great resource for students who have allergies, but it turns out almost no one knows about this resource... even the students with allergies. We figured out that this is a great example of lack of information, and staff members should definitely spread the word about the existence of this room so more people can make use of this resource. </p>

                                <p> The chapels are a great example of historical specificity, as they were designed in a very thoughtful way. The structures are equal in size, and no chapel casts a shadow on another so that all religions can be represented as equal. I love this design idea, and this was actually one of the first historical facts I learned about Brandeis. </p>

                                <p> Right next to SSC, there is a repair station designed to provide instruments for people who might need to fix their bikes. I think this is a fabulous design idea, as it encourages sustainability and the reuse of broken bikes! </p>

                                <p>There are free menstrual products in almost every women's bathroom on campus as well as in some of the all-gender restrooms. As a woman, I have made use of these resources, and I am so happy that people have implemented this health and wellness project.</p>

                                <p> The flags can be found in Heller School, and they represent design for cultural inclusivity. The different flags represent the countries of all the enrolled students in Heller School so that the students can feel comfortable and seen. As an international student, I felt so excited about seeing these flags! </p>
