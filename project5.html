The signalizing button can assist anyone in preserving their safety, as also, crossing a road in the dark can be extremely dangerous for anyone. </li>

I love how Brandeis has these yellow bumps around campus, as they do make the campus more accessible for people without one or more of the five senses. </li>

                               <li> I love how there are plenty of reserved parking spaces for people with disability around campus. As my grandma has mobility problems and finds it difficult to walk for a long time, my family has always loved these parking spots, which make certain places much more accessible for my grandma.</li>

                                <li> Before doing this group activity, I never knew that baby stations were around campus! As Heller School hosts many events with guests outside of Brandeis, I think this might be why there is a baby station in the women's bathroom there. I think this is a great design for moms with their babies and would definitely make parents' lives easier! </li>

                                <li> This accessible lift is located at the Abraham Shapiro Academic Complex. There are just two levels in this small building, but the lift has been designed specifically for staff members (as it leads to the staff offices) with ADA needs. I was so happy when I saw this lift in the building, as it showed how considerate the designers were about accommodating all people. </li>

                        <li>As one of my life goals is to create a technology that would help bridge the existing inequalities in society, Project 4 motivated me to think about that goal and do my best with the resources I had. I worked with Hannah on this project, and we really tried to be aware of what we were doing, how we were doing it, and what we could have done more if it was a real-life project. We started by reviewing all the documentation on e-NABLE hub and NIH 3D. For me, it was quite terrifying at first, as I couldn’t imagine myself creating a prosthesis that fast, especially with having to assemble so many different parts together. However, the tutorials and having a partner truly helped! The paper tutorial was useful, showing me that assembling the pieces was like a puzzle. However, the video tutorial truly helped me to visualize things better and understand how the prosthesis should work. </li>

                        </div>
                        <li>We downloaded all the parts of the Phoenix Hand V3 from NIH 3D in a zip folder and decided to create a left prosthesis. We used PrusaSlicer directly to scale all the parts to 150%. Firstly, we decided to print just the left hand, using organic supports, to see how it turned out. However, it was a disaster. During our next class, we couldn’t find our hand, which ultimately meant that the print failed, and someone threw it away. We gave it one more shot, and this time, we did not add any organic support to any pieces. We had two print jobs- the left hand and all the other pieces. We used black matte filament, as we wanted to aim for a professional and elegant look!</li>

                        <li>After the prints were ready, Hannah took them and put most of the pieces together. Afterward, we worked together on fixing some minor errors and making the final touches. Hannah showed me how all the pieces were working together like a real-life puzzle, and it was so fascinating to me how powerful the engineering mindset is! Everything looked perfect except for two things. Firstly, the snap pins were a bit too big, probably due to a printing error, and they fell off easily. Also, two of the tensioner pins were a bit too small for the tensioner block’s holes and fell off easily. We decided to use a very sticky glue to fix these minor errors, and suddenly, the hand was working just as intended! </li>
