                        <li>However, during the assembly process, Hannah and I were thinking about the Phoenix Hand V3 design and how useful and practical actually it is in real life for the people who were going to use it. Unfortunately, we did not have a person who needed that hand in our team to work with them, as a good designer always does, but we were brainstorming ways to add extra features to the hand. We started thinking about how much force a person has to put for the hand to work, and we asked ourselves- “What if there is a way to reduce the effort a person has to exert when using the hand?”. That is how we got thinking about the principle of the pulley- using less force to do a certain task with the help of a simple mechanism. In our case, we were going to put a cylindrical wheel on the arm guard above which the strings that controlled the movement of the fingers would go. In that way, we would reduce the tension and help the person using the hand to exert less force and feel less tired after using the hand for a long time.</li>

                            <div class="more-image1">

                        </div>
                        <li>After sketching our idea on a newspaper, I tried sketching the new hand modification on CAD. The idea is that two torus-shaped pieces would go through the arm guard with the help of four little holes. A cylindrical-shaped wheel would go through the torus-shaped pieces lying on the arm guard between the tensioner block and the palm. When a person pushes their hand inside the Phoneix Hand V3, they can apply less force to catch something. Even though it was not a revolutionary new feature, we thought that this simple mechanism could really help people who need and use this hand with their everyday tasks.</li>
                        <li>Still, there is a significant problem in our project. Yes, we printed the pieces. Yes, we assembled them correctly. And yes, we thought of a proper modification. However, we missed the central and most important figure in our design process- the person who was actually going to use this hand. The main principle of the design thinking process is the human-centered approach, but how could we know if we were designing effectively and usefully if we did not have contact with the person we were designing for? As Sara Hendren says in her “What Can a Body Do?” book: “In the pursuit of utility and significance, design can include making something new, but it can also include unmaking the world as it is, or perhaps remaking it, with parts and systems alike” (Hendren, 2020, p.26). </li>

                        <li>What if, instead of searching for a modification for the Phoenix Hand V3, we had to consider modifying the outside world? For example, Hannah and I were aiming to reduce the force that a person exerts when trying to hold and carry something like a water bottle. Instead of designing a modification to the hand using the pulley principle of mechanics, we could have considered adding an additional part to the water bottle, such as a specific hook that can make taking it easier and more accessible. We could never know, though, what we should change before talking to the people we are designing for. We should never look for the “easiest” solution, such as fixing a prosthesis design, but rather look at the whole picture- “What if we redesign the outside world?”. Next time, when I design an accessible technology like the prosthesis hand, I would love to talk to a person or, preferably, different people who need and want to use this hand so that I can figure out how to design it more effectively, what modifications to create for it, and possibly- how to modify the outside world as well.</li>

                        <li>As one of my life goals is to create a technology that would help bridge the existing inequalities in society, Project 4 motivated me to think about that goal and do my best with the resources I had. I worked with Hannah on this project, and we really tried to be aware of what we were doing, how we were doing it, and what we could have done more if it was a real-life project. We started by reviewing all the documentation on e-NABLE hub and NIH 3D. For me, it was quite terrifying at first, as I couldn’t imagine myself creating a prosthesis that fast, especially with having to assemble so many different parts together. However, the tutorials and having a partner truly helped! The paper tutorial was useful, showing me that assembling the pieces was like a puzzle. However, the video tutorial truly helped me to visualize things better and understand how the prosthesis should work. </li>

                        <li>We downloaded all the parts of the Phoenix Hand V3 from NIH 3D in a zip folder and decided to create a left prosthesis. We used PrusaSlicer directly to scale all the parts to 150%. Firstly, we decided to print just the left hand, using organic supports, to see how it turned out. However, it was a disaster. During our next class, we couldn’t find our hand, which ultimately meant that the print failed, and someone threw it away. We gave it one more shot, and this time, we did not add any organic support to any pieces. We had two print jobs- the left hand and all the other pieces. We used black matte filament, as we wanted to aim for a professional and elegant look!</li>

                        <li>After the prints were ready, Hannah took them and put most of the pieces together. Afterward, we worked together on fixing some minor errors and making the final touches. Hannah showed me how all the pieces were working together like a real-life puzzle, and it was so fascinating to me how powerful the engineering mindset is! Everything looked perfect except for two things. Firstly, the snap pins were a bit too big, probably due to a printing error, and they fell off easily. Also, two of the tensioner pins were a bit too small for the tensioner block’s holes and fell off easily. We decided to use a very sticky glue to fix these minor errors, and suddenly, the hand was working just as intended! </li>
