                    <h2>Keychain Print</h2>
                    <ul class="keychain-print-text">
                        <li>Before this class, I had never done 3D printing, which made this project so remarkable and exciting for me. The first thing I did was download the PrusaSlicer software on my Windows laptop. I created an account in the app to store and access my files quickly, and then I followed Professor Krones’ instructions about the software setup that we needed for our class. I set the printing settings to 0.20 mm SPEED, the filament to Prusament PLA, and the printer to Original Prusa MINI & MINI+ Input Shaper. Then, I downloaded the nametag 3MF file to my Desktop and used the menu settings in PrusaSlicer to open the file in the software. I tried zooming in and out of the model and looking around its details to understand better the prototype I would print. Afterward, I clicked the “Slice now” button on the bottom right, and I got a color print legend and a slider on the side, which allowed me to see the printing time, edit the number of colors I wanted, and choose where the printer should allow me to change the color filaments. However, I did not know yet that I could use these settings to do that, so I just didn’t touch anything and consequently, printed my keychain in only one color.</li>
                        <li>My next step included taking a USB flash drive from the classroom and clicking the “Export G-code” button on PrusaSlicer, which allowed me to put the keychain model’s code on the USB flash drive. Then, I filled out the print job number request form and received an automatic email with a number I wrote down on a sticky piece of paper. I went to one of the currently available 3D printers, and I plugged the USB flash drive on the side and stuck the note with my print job number in front of the machine. I saw I had purple filament put into my machine, so I did not touch anything apart from checking if the string was untangled. I realized that the 3D printer did not have a touch screen, so I used the big orange button in the middle to confirm my printing request.</li>

                        <li>After a while, I went back to the 3D printer I was using to check if my keychain was ready, and it was! I slightly moved the table away from the machine and pressed it on the sides so the keychain could easily slip off. I had to remove some extra filament strings with my fingers and throw them away in the bin, but my keychain looked terrific! I loved my first 3D print, for sure. However, I just wished I had known how to make it multicolored before slicing it so that it could have been even more beautiful!</li>

                    <h2>Failed Print</h2>
                    <ul class="keychain-print-text">
                        <li>My second attempt at 3D printing resulted in a more colorful but also more imperfect 3D model. I started my search for a model that would push the printer to its limits by checking the “printables.com” website. I had a hard time finding a model that would not work on the Prusa MINI+ because I was not exactly sure what I had to look for: too many edges, too many layers, or too many details, maybe? However, I ended up searching the keywords “printing torture test” and stopped myself at a model called “Original Prusa SL1 Test Object”. I chose to print this design as it seemed to have too many details and thin lines sticking out on the sides, so I thought the machine might be imperfect in this printing job. I downloaded the STL file and imported it to PrusaSlicer.</li>
                        <img src="assets/original_man_model.jpg" alt="Failed Print" class="keychain-image">
                        <li>As the first model I printed was the keychain in 3MF format, I noticed two main differences between the STL and 3MF formats. The first one was that STL files are much bigger than 3MF files, so it took me longer to download the STL file. Also, I checked online that STL stands for “Standard Triangle Language” and 3MF for “3D Manufacturing Model”, which meant that STL stores the model’s geometry information in triangles, whereas 3MF files could store more characteristics and be more precise in the geometry details. That is when I realized there might be some issues with printing out my Original Prusa SL1 Test Object.</li>
                        <li>Before slicing my object, I used the slider on the side to choose three different colors for my model as I separated the object into three nearly equal parts. I put times on my phone for when the different parts would be ready so that I could go and change the filament on time.</li>
                        <img src="assets/man.jpg" alt="Failed Print" class="keychain-image">
                        <li>Everything went perfectly well in the beginning. As I was changing the filaments, I made sure that the strings were untangled and that I pushed the filament string as much as possible into the machine so that the printer could read the new color change.</li>
                        <img src="assets/man1.jpg" alt="Failed Print" class="keychain-image">
                        <li>My final model looked similar to the one in the STL file but had some imperfections. The words in the middle- “Original Prusa SL1” are hard to read, and the sharp edges on the side are missing or look messy, as the machine failed to print them out. I believe that the edges were too small and sharp for the printer to be able to print them out. Also, I think that if the file had been in a 3MF format instead of STL, the printing would have been more precise and clean. I realized that the 3D printing machine does have its limitations, and more detailed and edgy models should definitely be printed a couple of times, preferably in 3MF format and from different sides, such as upside down for example, so that we can figure out what will help the Prusa MINI+ to print our perfect model!</li>
