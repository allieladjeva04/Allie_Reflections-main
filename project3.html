                        <li> When we first started Project 3, I was really nervous, as I had never considered myself good at hands-on tasks and having a good engineering vision. However, there is a Bulgarian saying- “When adversity knocks on your door, anything is possible.” In the soldering process, I first had trouble melting the solder in the right amount, as I was applying too much of it on the plate. However, after several unsuccessful attempts, I started getting better at melting the right amount of solder, such that it looked like a pyramid from the sides. After soldering all the parts from the electronic kit, I tested my alarm clock on my laptop, and it didn’t work immediately. I saw too much solder on two places of my plate, which might have created some joints. I fixed them and tried again, but it was still not working. Professor Krones helped me by giving me a new USB cable to try, and it turned out that this was the problem. Everything was working with the new USB cable, and Asa and I were ready to work together on the next step- designing a 3D-printed enclosure for the alarm clock. The measurements of our electronic alarm clocks were almost the same- 45 and 55 mm.</li>

                        <li>Next, we worked on our idea for the enclosure. We created a sketch that visualized the alarm clock box- it was steeper from the front, and it had two holes at the front for the alarm clock buttons and one on the side for the USB cable. The back of the box was going to be a detachable part so that we could insert the electronics kit from there. There was also an inside part with two half-holes, where we were going to attach two oblong cylindrical parts with springs so that the person using the alarm clock could press the buttons from the front, and these two parts would touch the buttons on the electronics kit, thus activating the clock.</li>

                        <li>We started using Fusion together, as the collaboration function on the software looked as follows- we could work together on the same file, but we couldn’t save the changes simultaneously, so we took turns saving the newest changes. We implemented the sketch and extrude functions on Fusion to create the box, using different features from the Solid-Mody and Solid-Create menus, such as the hole function for making the holes. We had two parameters: width set to 55 mm and height set to 45 mm. We also worked on designing four planets on the top that had to fit perfectly in the spots we created with extrude. </li>

                        <li>When printing the model from PrusaSlicer, we got a warning that we should add organic support almost everywhere, including underneath the steeper wall, so that it doesn’t fall. We put the two oblong cylindrical parts at a greater distance from each other, as we also got a warning that they were too close together. After that, we started printing! </li>
                        <li>After getting our first 3D print, we noticed that there were a couple of minor imperfections, even though the box looked fabulous. We modified some of the measurements, specifically for the holes, so that they could fit the electronic kit perfectly, and also, the planets and the two oblong parts were a bit thin. After correcting all that, we had our second print, which looked perfect!</li>

                        <li>Using Tinkercad was definitely a fun and inspiring experience for me. I always thought I was not good at designing things simply because I couldn’t draw and visualize things well, but after watching the Tinkercad tutorial, I felt like I could create any model I wanted. In class, I started researching different 3D models on the “thangs.com” website as I brainstormed ideas about making something I need and can use daily. I found a bookholder 3D model, which seemed fascinating to me since I am obsessed with books, and I could definitely see it on my desk. The more fascinating thing was that the bookholder had an empty space on the side for an object, such as a cup, where I thought, "Why don’t I find another 3D model to mix at that spot?”.</li>

                        <li>After brainstorming what would look best and be handy at that spot, I searched for a 3D model of a phone stand, as I could definitely put my phone on my side. I found an adorable headphone stand, and my next step was sketching everything on paper to see if it would look nice. I loved the sketch and decided to try the 3D remix on Tinkercad!</li>
                        <img src="assets/Tinkercad.png" alt="Tinkercad" class="keychain-image">
                        <li>I opened Tinkercad and imported the two STL files into my project workspace. I used the cube with the different labels on the sides to look at my project from different axes and figure out where I should put the phone stand. I had some trouble navigating the different sides, as the cube bugged often, but I finally managed to place the phone stand on the cup spot of the bookholder. I grouped the two objects, as I wanted to make sure that the phone stand would be merged perfectly with the bookholder and not just fly in the air. I also changed the height of the stand so that it is a little shorter than the bookholder, as this was the best-looking design for me. Afterward, I exported the file from Tinkercad to my laptop and opened it in PrusaSlicer. </li>

                        <li>As I opened the project in PrusaSlicer, I got a warning at the bottom, saying that I should add support to my object to prevent falling parts. Initially, I didn’t know what that meant, but thanks to Professor Krones and Vincent’s help, I added organic support from the settings, which supported the top part of my phone stand. Since my model was relatively big at this point and needed too much time to be printed, I scaled it down to a printing time of approximately one hour and a half. I ensured all the correct settings were on and sliced my object. Then, I got a 3D Printing Job number and moved the file to a USB flash drive so that I could print it out on a 3D printer.</li>

                        </div>
                        <li>Everything went smoothly, and my model was printed out, but there were some imperfections that I could have designed better. The stick of the phone holder was really thin and could easily break, so I had to design it a bit thicker, especially if it was supposed to support a phone. Also, my bookholder would have looked better if it was a bit wider. However, I decided to try a different 3D remix for my second model in Fusion, as I felt that the phone holder was too simple, and I was aiming for a more artistic design.</li>
